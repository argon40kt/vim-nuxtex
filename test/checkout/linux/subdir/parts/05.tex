\section{Compile (La)TeX documents}

Once set up the compile method at |nuxtex-set-compiler|, then, you can compile the documents by |:make| or |:lmake|. The first command will output the compiler message in the quickfix list and the last one will output in the location list. How to open these lists is described in |nuxtex-quickfix|.
