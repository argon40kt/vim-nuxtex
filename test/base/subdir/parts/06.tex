\section{Load quickfix list from compiler log}


If you would like to load the past compile error or warning to quickfix list, you can load *.log file by |:cfile| command after set up |nuxtex-set-compiler|.  The *.log file is generated by (La)TeX compiler default. For example, if `latex foo.tex` was executed, `foo.log` will be generated automatically. Then, you will launch vim, and can import the log file by these commands.

>
	:compiler nuxtex
	:cfile foo.log
	:copen
<

If you would like to load the log to location list, you can use |:lfile|
command instead of |:cfile|.

>
	:compiler nuxtex
	:lfile foo.log
	:lopen
<
